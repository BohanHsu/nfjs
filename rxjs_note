Javascript: single thread
denotational design with type class morphisms???

what's wrong with promises???
  can't cancel it. xhr could be canceled...
  when it's done, it is done. need to keep creating new promises. only has one return value
  are eager (cannot make it wait)
  cannot retry the promise

FRP
Data Flow Programming

Observer pattern
Iterator pattern
  pull: if you have next, then give me the next

Observalbe:
  Observer + Iterator == RX

Sequence over time

Creating Observable:

Pipe going down
Operators:
scan: infinate -> snapshot
  take a snapshot of what you have now, and then become finite stream

flatMap:
  element -> observable
  subscribe to all of them, create a number of observable and then flat them

Error handling
subscribe callback error:

.catch((e) => Rx.Observable.of({})
).subscribe

.retry

Hot & cold
hot -> live
  temporal
  missing events before subscribe

No way in the api to tell hot or cold

Reactive-Extensions/RxJS deplicated
ReactiveX/rxjs the latest version

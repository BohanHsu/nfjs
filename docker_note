================================================================================
docker pull jenkins:2.32.3 // download the image

run = create + start

docker run ubuntu
docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

dockerfile:
  text file, use docker build image from dockerfile

Docker bridge!!!

-v /host/path:/tmp
redirect /tmp on the container to /host/path on host system

Docker compose
Docker swarm


================================================================================

Union file system:
  delete files also increase the number of layers
  write space may cause cache miss

Order change,
  static on top, change things at bottom, layer & cache

FROM:
  First line on docker file

RUN:
  
ADD/COPY
  Avoid ADD

  dockerignore file:
  not load in the daemon

USER:
  Do not switch USER ofter
  Avoid using root
  Each user change add one layer

LABELS:
  
ENTRYPOINT/CMD
  Avoid the shell form
  Array form the process is root process
  Shell form the process is child of root process
